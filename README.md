# 📖 Overview

**Crisis Signal Detector** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that identifies whether an input text contains a potential crisis signal.

The project leverages a **fine-tuned BERT model** from Hugging Face Transformers for binary text classification and provides predictions through an intuitive **Streamlit** web interface.

This project was developed as the **final capstone project** during the **NAVTTC-sponsored Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Training Program** conducted at **Corvit Systems Bahawalpur**.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how transformer-based NLP models can assist in the early detection of crisis-related text, providing a foundation for intelligent mental health support systems.

- **Normal Text**

using a fine-tuned **BERT** model trained for binary text classification.

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from **Kaggle**.

**Dataset Link**

**Dataset:** [Suicide Watch Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch/data)

### Dataset Details

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Task:** Binary Text Classification
- **Original Dataset Size:** 130,000+ text samples
- **Classes:**
  - Crisis Signal
  - Normal Text

### Training Dataset

Although the original dataset contains over **130,000 samples**, the model was fine-tuned using a subset of **10,000 samples**.

This decision was made because the project was developed on hardware with limited computational resources during the NAVTTC training program. Using a carefully selected subset allowed efficient training while still producing reliable predictions for the prototype application.

---

# 🔬 Methodology

The project followed the complete Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipeline:

1. Dataset Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Text Preprocessing
5. Tokenization using the BERT Tokenizer
6. Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model
7. Model Evaluation
8. Deployment using Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces

The trained model predicts whether an input sentence represents a crisis signal and displays the prediction together with a confidence score.

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, several technical challenges were encountered:

- Working with a transformer-based BERT model on limited hardware resources.
- Training on a subset of the original dataset to reduce computational requirements.
- Managing the large size of the trained model during deployment.
- GitHub's file size limitation prevented uploading the `model.safetensors` file.
- Configuring and deploying the application successfully on Hugging Face Spaces.
- Organizing the repository to provide clear documentation while keeping it lightweight.

These challenges were addressed through dataset optimization, efficient deployment practices, and proper project organization.

---

# ⚠️ Model Weights

The trained model weights (`model.safetensors`) are **not included** in this repository because they exceed GitHub's maximum file size limit.

To explore the complete application, please use the deployed version on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
